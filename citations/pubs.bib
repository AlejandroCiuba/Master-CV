  abstract = {Paper evaluates the use of multilingual ASR models as the base model for low-resource language end-to-end speech translation. The paper first trains a multilingual model on six high-resource language pairs and then performs a last fine-tuning using only 300 hours of Tamashek speech to make a Tamashek to French speech translation system. They find their approach helped low-resource languages on the speech side, but potentially low-resource target languages could also benefit from this approach. They lastly simulated the effects of additional speech data by creating artificially low-resource datasets for English-to-Portuguese. They find models significantly improve between low- and medium-resource partitions, but not as much afterwards. The paper is a good reference on basic techniques to deploy when creating ASR systems for low-resource languages.},
